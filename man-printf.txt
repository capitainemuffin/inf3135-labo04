     The pprriinnttff utility formats and prints its arguments, after the first,
     under control of the _f_o_r_m_a_t.  The _f_o_r_m_a_t is a character string which con-
     tains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply copied
     to standard output, character escape sequences which are converted and
     copied to the standard output, and format specifications, each of which
     causes printing of the next successive _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.

     The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s after the first are treated as strings if the corresponding
     format is either cc, bb or ss; otherwise it is evaluated as a C constant,
     with the following extensions:
